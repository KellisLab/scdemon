* scdemon
** algorithm checklist
*** Normalization
batteries included
*** SVD/PCA/LSI
need extraction
*** PC filtering/adjustment
*** Adjacency
KNN with many NN -> 100? 500?

**** Full -> indices, indptr
**** Annoy (R/Python) -> indices, indptr (angular; need to pre-Zscore)
**** PyNNDescent (Python) -> indices, indptr (correlation)
*** Filtering KNN
Using CSR input -> indices, indptr,
compute standard errors and p-values
*** Community detection
BigCLAM/Leiden
